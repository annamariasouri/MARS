# MARS Dashboard

A small Streamlit dashboard and supporting scripts for daily marine forecasts and environmental data processing (Copernicus subsets, feature engineering, and a trained random forest model for chlorophyll prediction).

This repository includes scripts that download Copernicus NetCDF files, process them into CSVs used by the model, run daily forecasts, and a Streamlit app to visualise results.

## Files of interest

- `dashboard_app.py` — Streamlit app (UI).
- `download_copernicus_day_test.py` — downloads Copernicus data, merges NetCDFs, does feature engineering, and saves CSVs.
- `run_daily_forecast.py` — loads a trained model and creates daily forecasts (writes `forecast_log_*.csv`).
- `final_rf_chl_model_2015_2023.pkl` — trained random forest model used by `run_daily_forecast.py`.
- `*.csv` — example CSV files in the repository (e.g., `env_history_*.csv`, `model_ready_input_*.csv`, `forecast_log_*.csv`).

## Where CSVs are saved (important)

By default the scripts in this repo are configured to write and read CSVs from the project root (the folder containing this `README.md`). That path is:

```
C:\Users\annam\OneDrive - University of Nicosia\Desktop\DASHBOARD CODE
```

If you want to change where CSVs are stored, update the `output_dir` variable in `download_copernicus_day_test.py` and the `csv_input`/`output_path` variables in `run_daily_forecast.py`. If you'd like, I can centralise that path into a single `config.py` for you.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (a virtual environment is recommended)
- Internet access (for Copernicus downloads)

## Install dependencies

I included a `requirements.txt` with the typical packages used by the scripts. Create a virtual environment and install:

PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Streamlit app

From the project root (where `dashboard_app.py` is located):

```powershell
# activate env first (see above), then:
streamlit run "C:\Users\annam\OneDrive - University of Nicosia\Desktop\DASHBOARD CODE\dashboard_app.py"
```

Streamlit will open in your browser and the app will read CSVs from the project folder. Make sure the CSV files such as `env_history_{region}_{date}.csv` and `model_ready_input_{region}_{date}.csv` exist in the folder before running the app.

## Run the downloader and forecast scripts

Downloader (produces env_history and model-ready CSVs):

```powershell
python "C:\Users\annam\OneDrive - University of Nicosia\Desktop\DASHBOARD CODE\download_copernicus_day_test.py"
```

Forecast runner (reads `model_ready_input_*` files and writes `forecast_log_*`):

```powershell
python "C:\Users\annam\OneDrive - University of Nicosia\Desktop\DASHBOARD CODE\run_daily_forecast.py"
```

## Troubleshooting

- If Streamlit fails to find CSVs, confirm they exist in the project root and that file permissions are correct.
- If NetCDF downloads fail, ensure `copernicusmarine` (or your chosen client) is authenticated and internet access is available.
- If you get errors importing packages, verify that you installed `requirements.txt` into the same Python interpreter used to run Streamlit.

## Next steps (recommended)

- Create a `config.py` with a single `OUTPUT_DIR` constant and update scripts to import it. I can add this for you.
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow to run a basic linter/test pipeline.

If you want the `config.py` and a consolidated change across scripts (so the CSV path is defined in one place), tell me and I'll implement it.
